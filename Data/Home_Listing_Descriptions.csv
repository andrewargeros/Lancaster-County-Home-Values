Floor covering credit is for main level only. Sold AS-IS, Inspections/Inspection contingency permitted for information only, the seller is not knowingly hiding any defects, but is unable to make any repairs at this time. Buyer is responsible for any repairs required for financing. Settlement must be on or before 9/25/20. Rare opportunity at this price-point, to own a home with over 1,600 SF of finished living space, showcased far off a cul-de-sac street, within a private enclave of seemingly endless woodland, and just a stone through from Honey Brook Chester County.

A glass slider looks over the large level back yard, trees beyond. The dining area is open to the LR and grand foyer beyond. The spacious main bedroom has a handy passageway to the full hall bathroom.
