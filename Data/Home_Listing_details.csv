This beautiful colonial-style brick home provides the best of both town and country. On a spacious half acre with a detached two-story barn, this four-bedroom, two-bathroom house will provide both the accessibility of being close to the city with a relaxed rural setting in the quiet village of Salunga. This two-and-a-half story home was built circa 1945 and is in the top-ranking Hempfield School District. With recently refinished hardwood floors and bold woodwork throughout, this house exudes charm. This building has most recently been used as an office for Eastern Mennonite Missions, with some modifications made for this setting.

A large family room (fireplace isn't in use, but could be) is accessible to the second floor by one of the three staircases in this home. The gourmet kitchen is breathtaking. Monogram appliances, custom cabinetry, built in appliances, a huge center island with seating and a beautiful dark back splash that accents the light kitchen. This kitchen is a chef's dream. A large dining room will accommodate a large family get together or party. A formal living room with a second fireplace (not currently used) is off of the dining room.

The barn has plenty of storage for yard tractors and mowers and there is a one vehicle garage attached to it. You'll notice the attached three car garage that is oversize and has an unfinished storage area above it. The large deck with electronic awning is made of durable trex decking. As you enter the home, you'll feel like you've left the old farm house and walked into a brand new home. Engineered hardwood floors are throughout the first floor. A large family room (fireplace isn't in use, but could be) is accessible to the second floor by one of the three staircases in this home. The gourmet kitchen is breathtaking. Monogram appliances, custom cabinetry, built in appliances, a huge center island with seating and a beautiful dark back splash that accents the light kitchen. This kitchen is a chef's dream. A large dining room will accommodate a large family get together or party. A formal living room with a second fireplace (not currently used) is off of the dining room. You'll pass by the second of the three staircases. Located off of the kitchen is the large laundry room with sink and storage. Finally, on the first floor is the first bedroom (currently used as an office) which also has engineered hard wood floors. We move to the second floor (via the third staircase) to find four more spacious bedrooms. One point of note is that this home has a Master Bedroom as well as an en suite! You guessed it. Two master bedroom areas! The en suite has a oversize tile shower and tile floors and a wonderfully current dark gray theme. The Master Bedroom Suite has one of the most handsomely renovated bathrooms. A large, European walk in shower surrounded in glass, a soaking tub, separate his and hers vanities and access to the changing room.

Strategically positioned on the 2.7 acre lot, the park-like drive leading to the home~s circular driveway allows for viewing the home at all angles, and taking in the architects ability to blend modern architecture with a traditional German farmhouse. The front facade with its ~Telescope~ design, cedar clapboard siding, brick foundation and raised panel front door draws you into the traditional feel of this home, but that~s where the style of the home flows into the modern era, with its steel framed angular glass on the exposed sides and rear of the home. Once inside, natural light floods into the home at all angles from the numerous skylights, sliding glass doors and three-story south-facing glass wall, truly a departure from a traditional colonial-style residence.This 4 bedroom & 4 full and 3 (~) bath home has over 5,000 square feet above grade on 3 levels with an additional 900+ sq.ft finished Game-room on the lower level. The 3-story open foyer is accented by Pennsylvania bluestone floors and an exquisite view of the rear patio and fountain with ~floating~ steps.The spacious formal living room has 2 walls of windows bringing the outside in and highlights a mature grove of dogwood and the back patio and landscape. The home features a formal dining room with a soaring vaulted ceiling, custom designed built-in buffets and open mirrored curio shelving.One cannot overlook the modern top of the line appliances, ample cabinetry and countertops in the bright kitchen, including a center island with JennAir cooktop and grill, two deep pantries, Sub-Zero side-by-side, double convection ovens & warming drawer. The kitchen, dining room and living room all feature 8~ sliding glass doors that open to a 2-level Pennsylvania flagstone patio and fountain. The patio extends along the entire rear of the home, perfect for indoor/outdoor living and entertaining.The library is a few steps away from the kitchen, and has a wall of trademark Jacobsen ~egg crate~ style bookshelves with built-in file drawers, retractable screen and video/projector cabinet. The open riser circular staircase provides visual interest and access to all levels of the house. The second-floor Master Suite is complete with plush wool carpeting, architectural designed bedside tables and reading lamps, surround sound Klipsch speakers, master dressing area with ample built-ins, closets and storage and a sitting-room with views to the garden and dogwood grove. Central to the design of the Master Bath is the double oversized custom shower, floating vanities and a free-standing soaking tub, all featuring Dornbracht fixtures. The second bedroom is an en-suite (as are all the bedrooms), its streamlined built-in desk area and bedside tables add to the overall charm of the home. A full-sized walk-in cedar closet, small ~secret~ reading room and attic storage can be accessed from this bedroom. The third level is adorned by a vaulted ceiling, skylights and a wall of windows. Privacy for the sleeping end of this room was created with a custom built-in divider and with the walk-in closets and drawers at both ends of this space, make this an ideal bedroom and/or office. The other areas & features of this modern day masterpiece include the oversized mudroom, the 4th bedroom (again the presence of trademark bookshelves with sewing table & seating machine, hidden ironing board, private bath), plentiful pocket doors and closets galore. First floor laundry room with outside and basement entrance through oversized barn doors make this area possible as an additional garage space.
