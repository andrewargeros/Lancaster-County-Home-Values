# Lancaster County Home Values
 An analysis of home listings in Lancaster County, PA

## Data Generation

The file `zillowscrape.py` contains code to programmatically scrape listings of for-sale houses in each zip code within Lancaster County. These zip codes were first scraped from https://www.ciclt.net/sn/clt/capitolimpact/gw_ziplist.aspx?FIPS=42071 . Should you want to replicate this project for a different county, change the FIPS code parameter at the end of the link to that of the desired county (`?FIPS=`).
